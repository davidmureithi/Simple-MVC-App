<h1>Installation</h1>

ApPHP Framework can be installed on any modern hosting service that supports PHP or on a local web server.
If you are going to install ApPHP on your local machine, and don't have a web server software, we recommend
installing <a class="external" href="http://www.zend.com/en/products/server-ce/" target="_new">Zend CE</a> with an all-in-one package.
<br><br>

Also you may check if your current server settings meet ApPHP Framework requirements <a href="../utils/requirements/" target="_parent">here</a>.

<ol>
    <li>Download ApPHP Framework: <a class="external" href="http://apphp.com/php-framework/" target="_new">http://apphp.com/php-framework/</a>.</li>
    <li>Extract the package contents on your computer and upload its contents to the remote server's directory
        via FTP, where PHP scripts should be installed (for local installation copy all files from the archive to
        htdocs folder on your Zend CE installation). The contents of the installation directory must be accessible
        via HTTP, for example: <code>http://www.yourdomain.com/{installation_folder}/</code></li>
    <li>That's all! Congratulations, you have now ApPHP Framework installed.</li>        
</ol>
