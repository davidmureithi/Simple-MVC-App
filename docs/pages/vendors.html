<h1>Framework Structure - Vendors</h1>

Vendors are the third-party libraries that integrated to further extend ApPHP Framework's functionalities.
This is a framework-level vendor sub-directory and it contains all third-party modules or libraries 
which your application may need. The libraries and modules that placed in the vendor sub-directory
are not modified from their original, distributed state. As a developer you may use framework-level
vendors for your purposes, although it's generally intended for internal use of the framework
</code>helpers</code>.
<br><br>

Of course, you may create an application-level vendor sub-directory, that will be used for your application
purposes only. In this case you may create a a sub-folder called <code>vendors</code> and place it
in <code>protected</code> directory of your application. Find more information about application
vendors <a href="index.php?page=application-vendors">here</a>.

Currently there are following framework-level vendors:

<ul class="file-structure">
    <li class="folder-protected">
        <b>framework/</b> <span class="description">framework directory</span>
        <ul>
            <li class="folder-protected">
                <b>vendors/</b> <span class="description">directory where placed all vendors</span>
                <ul>
                    <li class="folder-protected"><b>phpmailer</b> <span class="description">php mailer files</span></li>
                </ul>                        
            </li>
        </ul>                    
    </li>
</ul>

Below you may see an example that illustrates how <code>CMailer</code> helper uses the <code>phpmailer</code>
vendor code from the ApPHP framework:
    
<pre name="dlhl" class="php">
public static function send($to, $subject, $message, $params = '')
{
    if(!strcasecmp(self::$_mailer, 'smtpMailer')){
        return self::smtpMailer($to, $subject, $message, $params);
    }else if(!strcasecmp(self::$_mailer, 'phpMailer')){
        return self::phpMailer($to, $subject, $message, $params);
    }else{
        return self::phpMail($to, $subject, $message, $params);
    }		
}
</pre>
